# Modern_Art_Live_Sketcher
A very simple program that will transform you into a modern art chef d'oeuvre.

Run the three cells and have fun living inside a modern piece of art. The program uses the webcam to capture the images and output the results in another window. No data is saved in any way.     

Fun thing to do: try to direct the webcam toward a TV or a phone playing another video.
